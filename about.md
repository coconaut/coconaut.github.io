Hey, my name's Alex. I've been thinking about starting one of these code blogs for a while now. I really appreciate it when I come across a code snippet that helps me, a post that raises my interest, or even a good rant about some programming quirk that's also been bothering me. Hopefully this will give me a chance to reciprocate. I'll try to keep it more code / example heavy and tone down the rants.

These days I've been writing a lot of Elixir, so there will probably be a strong slant towards Elixir and Erlang-related posts. But I'm into all things function programming, dabble in machine learning, work in .NET at my day job, and also play around a lot with C++ and even some assembly lately, so there should be a healthy mix of topics on here.

Stay tuned.
